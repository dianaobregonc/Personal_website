## Stingless bee beekeeping and conservation

Stingless bees (Meliponini: Apidae) are eusocial bees that form the most abundant and diverse group of bees throughout the tropics. These bees play a key role in the reproduction of many wild plants, as well as being important flower visitors of multiple crops. Indigenous and local communities use the honey, pollen, cerumen, and propolis from stingless bees for their own consumption or to sell in local markets as food or medicine. 

Stingless bees, as well as other wild bees, are suffering the negative impact of the loss of natural habitat, pesticides, and pathogens. Moreover, these bees are highly dependent on the forest because most of the species nest in cavities of old trees. We can help to protect them by protecting their natural habitat, reducing the use of pesticides, and helping communities to make a rational use of these colonies.
